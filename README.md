# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of Titanic passengers using a **Random Forest machine learning model**.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, and family details.
- **Dataset:** titanic dataset was provided by Rhombic technologies.
- **Techniques Used:** 
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns)
  - Label encoding for categorical variables
  - Feature scaling (Age, Fare)
  - Random Forest Classifier for prediction
  - Model evaluation (Accuracy, Feature Importance, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run `titanic_model.py` using Python.
3. The script outputs:
   - Model accuracy
   - Feature importance
   - Confusion matrix & classification report
   - CSV file with predicted results for the test set (`titanic_predictions.csv`)
